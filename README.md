Sure, here's a basic README template for your Airflow DAG script:

Weather DAG
This Airflow DAG script retrieves weather data for Houston using the OpenWeatherMap API, transforms the data, and saves it to an Amazon S3 bucket as a CSV file.

Description
This DAG consists of three tasks:

is_weather_api_ready: HTTP sensor task that checks if the OpenWeatherMap API is available.
extract_weather_data: HTTP operator task that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
transform_load_weather_data: Python operator task that transforms the retrieved weather data and saves it to an S3 bucket.
Dependencies
Airflow: Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.
pandas: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library.
requests: requests is a simple HTTP library for Python.
boto3: Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python.
Configuration
Set up Airflow with the necessary connections and variables for the OpenWeatherMap API and AWS credentials.
Make sure the required Python packages (pandas, requests, boto3) are installed in your Airflow environment.
Configure the start_date and schedule_interval parameters in the DAG definition according to your requirements.
Usage
Place the script in your Airflow DAGs directory ($AIRFLOW_HOME/dags).
Ensure that Airflow is running, and the DAG will be automatically picked up and scheduled according to the specified interval.
